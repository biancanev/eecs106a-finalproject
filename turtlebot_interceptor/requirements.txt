# Python Requirements for TurtleBot Interceptor Project
# 
# Installation:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Note: For ROS2 nodes, you also need ROS2 (Humble/Foxy) installed via apt.
# ROS2 packages (rclpy, geometry_msgs, nav_msgs, sensor_msgs) are installed via apt, not pip.

# Core Scientific Computing
numpy>=1.21.0

# Optimization (for MPC)
cvxpy>=1.2.0
osqp>=0.6.0  # OSQP solver backend for cvxpy (optional but recommended)

# Visualization (for simulation)
matplotlib>=3.5.0

# 3D Transformations (for ROS2 nodes)
transforms3d>=0.4.1

# ROS2 Python Client Library
# Note: rclpy is typically installed via apt on Ubuntu:
#   sudo apt-get install -y python3-rosdep python3-colcon-common-extensions
#   sudo apt-get install -y ros-humble-rclpy ros-humble-geometry-msgs ros-humble-nav-msgs ros-humble-sensor-msgs
# If installing via pip (not recommended for ROS2), uncomment below:
# rclpy>=3.3.0

# Optional: For development and testing
# pytest>=7.0.0  # Uncomment if running tests
